ML_Functions_KeyNumbersAlgorithms.py
    Contains many functions that analyze situations, i.e. pass key numbers. Functions require arrays as input and do not read directly from files.
    Needs to be read in more detail.

ML_Functions_Load_Array.py
    Functions to read and organize files from raw data. pretty readable.
    To read when we need some data from raw. 


RestructureData_2425/Team 
here 4 folders 
    1 All data 
    2 Others 
    3 Passes 
    4 XGData

    1: All data : 
    file names: Game_{TeamHome}_{TeamAway}_Score_{Home}_{Away}_Day_{Date}.pkl
    columns really difficult to tell becuase of the format, there's a function in ML_Functions_Load_Array.py, 
    that suggets (at least to me) that the data are positions per time. 
    Function to read it :
        SecLoad(TeamA,nameSC,igame): 
            returns 4 array with (I think): 
            Time,Ball_position,Team_looking_for_position,Opponents_position
    
    2 Others: 
    Full of different sutff, can't find functions to read them, but seems possible to write one stealing from the others.


    3 Passes: 
    file names: Passes_{TeamHome}_{TeamAway}_Score_{Home}_{Away}_Day_{Date}.txt
    not really clear what is inside


    4 XGData: 
    file names: XGData_{TeamHome}_{TeamAway}_Score_{Home}_{Away}_Day_{Date}.txt
    Columns: 
        0: Xg_value
        1: half
        2: min
        3: sec 
        4: nplay 
        5: xgnumber
        6: xgteam
        7: xgpos1 
        8: xgpos2
    not really clear the others 
    definition and reaaders of it is in : 
                                        ML_Functions_Load_Array.py, OptaLoad(TeamA,nameXG,igame) :
                                            returns XGPlayers,XGNumbers,XGTeam,XGValue,XGHalf,XGMin,XGSec,XGTimes,XGPos1,XGPos2
                                        ML_Functions_Load_Array.py, MacihneLearning_OptaLoad(TeamA,nameXG,igame):
                                            return XGNumbers,XGTeam,XGValue,XGHalf,XGMin,XGSec,XGTimes,XGPos1,XGPos2
